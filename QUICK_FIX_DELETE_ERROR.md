## If Still Getting 400 Error

**Check if property has related records**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM property_images WHERE property_id = 6;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM favorites WHERE property_id = 6;
```

If count > 0, delete related records first:
```sql
DELETE FROM property_images WHERE property_id = 6;
DELETE FROM favorites WHERE property_id = 6;
```

Then try deleting property again.
